# YouTube-GPT
## This Project is built with the application of the langchain with llm.
## Built with the streamlit app can help us get a visual experience of this YouTube-GPT.
## YouTube-GPT can be used in your local machine by simply replacing the apikey with your own chatgpt api key.
## You can run this YouTube-GPT by using the command (streamlit run app.py) in your command prompt.
## This is simple yet powerful because of the integration with the chatgpt.
# Thank You!
